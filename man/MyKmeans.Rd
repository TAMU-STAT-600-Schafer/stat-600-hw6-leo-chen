\title{K-means Clustering Algorithm}
\usage{
MyKmeans(X, K, M = NULL, numIter = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix of n observations (rows) and p variables (columns).
Each row represents an observation and each column represents a feature.}

\item{K}{Integer specifying the number of clusters (must be positive and less
than the number of observations).}

\item{M}{Optional initial K x p matrix of cluster centers. If NULL (default),
K rows will be randomly sampled from X as initial centers.}

\item{numIter}{Maximum number of iterations for the algorithm (default: 100).
The algorithm may converge earlier.}
}
\value{
A vector of cluster assignments (integers from 1 to K) where the i-th
        element indicates the cluster assignment for the i-th observation.
}
\description{
Implements K-means clustering algorithm using C++ for efficient computation.
The algorithm partitions n observations into K clusters by minimizing the
within-cluster sum of squares. Uses Euclidean distance as the distance metric.
}
\details{
The algorithm implements the standard k-means clustering using the following steps:
1. Initialize cluster centers (randomly or with provided centers)
2. Assign each point to the nearest center
3. Update centers as the mean of assigned points
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until convergence or maximum iterations

The implementation includes checks for empty clusters and uses efficient
matrix operations through RcppArmadillo.

\examples{
# Generate sample data with two well-separated clusters
set.seed(123)
n_per_cluster <- 50
X <- rbind(
  matrix(rnorm(n_per_cluster * 2, mean = 0, sd = 0.3), ncol = 2),
  matrix(rnorm(n_per_cluster * 2, mean = 2, sd = 0.3), ncol = 2)
)

# Run clustering
clusters <- MyKmeans(X, K = 2)

# Plot results
plot(X, col = clusters, pch = 16,
     main = "K-means Clustering Results",
     xlab = "Feature 1", ylab = "Feature 2")
legend("topright", legend = paste("Cluster", 1:2),
       col = 1:2, pch = 16)

# Example with custom initial centers
M <- matrix(c(0, 0, 2, 2), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
clusters_custom <- MyKmeans(X, K = 2, M = M)
