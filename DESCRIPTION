Title: K-means Clustering and Multi-class Logistic Regression Implementation
Version: 1.0.1
Date: 2024-03-20
Author: Yang, Chen and Wang, Zexian
Maintainer: Wang, Zexian <leowang@tamu.edu>
Description: This package provides efficient implementations of K-means clustering 
    and multi-class logistic regression algorithms using C++ via Rcpp and 
    RcppArmadillo. The K-means implementation supports custom initialization 
    and handles various edge cases. The multi-class logistic regression 
    implementation includes ridge regularization and damped Newton's method 
    for optimization.
